# Additional tasks on different topics:
## List of written programs:
### 1. Task 1:
**Description:** Complete the following tasks using the Counter collection:
1. Create a new collection
2. Count the number of members in the collection using the len() function
3. Verify that the item belongs to the collection using the "in" operator
4. Substring search
5. Scan a collection using a loop operator
6. Find the maximum, minimum elements of the collection, as well as the sum of all elements
7. Find the number of user-defined collection item
8. Convert collection type
9. Sorting collection items

**Code:** [task1.py](./task1.py)

### 2. Multiples of 3 and 5:
**Description:** If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.  
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

**Code:** [multiples_of_3or5.py](./multiples_of_3or5.py)

### 3. Even Fibonacci numbers:
**Description:** Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:  
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...  
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
