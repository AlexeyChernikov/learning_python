# Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner (Michael Dawson):
## List of written programs:
### 1. Game over:
**Description:** The program displays "Game Over" and waits for the Enter key to be pressed to complete.

**Code:** [game_over.py](./game_over.py)

### 2. Unusua dish:
**Description:** Write a program in the window of which the user can enter the names of his two favorite dishes. The program should concatenate these two lines and display the resulting line as the name of a new unprecedented dish.

**Code:** [unusua_dish.py](./unusua_dish.py)

### 3. Generous Visitor:
**Description:** Write the “Generous Visitor” program, in the window of which the user can enter the invoice amount for lunch at the restaurant. The program should display two values: tips at the rate of 15% and 20% of the specified amount.

**Code:** [generous_visitor.py](./generous_visitor.py)

### 4. Car Dealer:
**Description:** Write the program "Car Dealer", in the window of which the user can enter the cost of the car without extra charges. The program should add a few additional amounts to it: tax, registration fee, agency fee, delivery price of the car at the destination. Let the tax and registration fee be calculated as a fraction of the initial cost, and the remaining margins will be considered fixed values. The final price of the car should be displayed on the screen.

**Code:** [car_dealer.py](./car_dealer.py)

### 5. Simulator of a pie with a surprise:
**Description:** Write a pie-simulator program with a "surprise" that, when launched, would display one of five different "Surprises" selected at random.

**Code:** [surprise_pie_simulator.py](./surprise_pie_simulator.py)

### 6. Toss a coin:
**Description:** Write a program that would "Flip" a conditional coin 100 times and report how many times an eagle has fallen, and how many tails.

**Code:** [toss_a_coin.py](./toss_a_coin.py)

### 7. Guess the number:
**Description:** Write a game "Guess the Number" with a limited number of attempts.

**Code:** [guess_the_number.py](./guess_the_number.py)

### 8. Guess the number (version where the computer guesses):
**Description:** Write the game "guess the number". A person chooses a number, and the computer guesses.

**Code:** [guess_the_number_computer.py](./guess_the_number_computer.py)

### 9. Simple counter:
**Description:** Write a program that would be considered at the request of the user. You must allow the user to enter the beginning and end of the interval, as well as the step.

**Code:** [simple_counter.py](./simple_counter.py)

### 10. String reverse:
**Description:** Write a program that accepts text from user input and prints this text on the screen in reverse.

**Code:** [string_reverse.py](./string_reverse.py)

### 11. Guess the word:
**Description:** Create a game in which the computer selects a word, and the player must guess it. The computer tells the player how many letters are in a word, and gives five attempts to find out if there is any letter in the word, with the program only able to answer "Yes" and "No". After that, the player must try to guess the word.

**Code:** [guess_the_word.py](./guess_the_word.py)

### 12. The list is in random order:
**Description:** Create a program that will output a list of words in random order. All words from the list must be printed on the screen without repeating.

**Code:** [list_in_rand_order.py](./list_in_rand_order.py)

### 13. Character generator:
**Description:** Write a "Character generator" program for a role-playing game. The user should be given 30 points, which can be distributed among four characteristics: Strength, Health, Intelligence, and Dexterity. We need to make sure that the user can not only take these items from the General "pool", but also return them there from the characteristics that they decide to assign other values to.

**Code:** [character_generator.py](./character_generator.py)
