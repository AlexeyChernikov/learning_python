# Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner (Michael Dawson):
## List of written programs:
### 1. Game over:
**Description:** The program displays "Game Over" and waits for the Enter key to be pressed to complete.

**Code:** [game_over.py](./game_over.py)

### 2. Unusua dish:
**Description:** Write a program in the window of which the user can enter the names of his two favorite dishes. The program 
should concatenate these two lines and display the resulting line as the name of a new unprecedented dish.

**Code:** [unusua_dish.py](./unusua_dish.py)

### 3. Generous Visitor:
**Description:** Write the “Generous Visitor” program, in the window of which the user can enter the invoice amount for lunch 
at the restaurant. The program should display two values: tips at the rate of 15% and 20% of the specified amount.

**Code:** [generous_visitor.py](./generous_visitor.py)

### 4. Car Dealer:
**Description:** Write the program "Car Dealer", in the window of which the user can enter the cost of the car without extra 
charges. The program should add a few additional amounts to it: tax, registration fee, agency fee, delivery price of the car 
at the destination. Let the tax and registration fee be calculated as a fraction of the initial cost, and the remaining margins 
will be considered fixed values. The final price of the car should be displayed on the screen.

**Code:** [car_dealer.py](./car_dealer.py)

### 5. Simulator of a pie with a surprise:
**Description:** Write a pie-simulator program with a "surprise" that, when launched, would display one of five different 
"Surprises" selected at random.

**Code:** [surprise_pie_simulator.py](./surprise_pie_simulator.py)

### 6. Toss a coin:
**Description:** Write a program that would "Flip" a conditional coin 100 times and report how many times an eagle has 
fallen, and how many tails.

**Code:** [toss_a_coin.py](./toss_a_coin.py)

### 7. Guess the number:
**Description:** Write a game "Guess the Number" with a limited number of attempts.

**Code:** [guess_the_number.py](./guess_the_number.py)

### 8. Guess the number (version where the computer guesses):
**Description:** Write the game "guess the number". A person chooses a number, and the computer guesses.

**Code:** [guess_the_number_computer.py](./guess_the_number_computer.py)
